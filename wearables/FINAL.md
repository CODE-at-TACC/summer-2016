# Final Project

Design a device that makes someone's life easier

What device are you making?

- Is there a cloud integration?
- If x happens, do y notification

Draw diagram

- what kind of sensors are you using?
- where are your sensors drawing power?
- where are your sensor inputs?
- where are your outputs connected?

Sewing with conductive thread - start on physical product 

Use photon redboard to build prototype for coding
