# Development Boards and GPIO Pins

### Introduction

Development boards are programmable microcontrollers that are designed to conveniently connect to a variety sensors and output devices. When your wearable device goes into production, an engineer will take all of the components and the development board processor and create a single integrated device.

### Particle.io Photon

We're using the Particle.io Photon as our development board. It works almost exactly the same as the SparkFun Photon Redboard you used in the Robotics unit. However, we have to find a way to provide power in a convenient format that makes the device wearable.

### PowerBoost 500C

We will be using a power module called the PowerBoost 500C. It allows you to connect your Photon to a small Lithium Polymer battery, provide recharging capabilities, and turn on and off the device. This makes your project smaller, and you won't require a separate USB battery pack to power the project.
