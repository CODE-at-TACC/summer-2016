### _**Wearables, Robotics and the Internet of Things**_

Welcome to the CODE @ TACC Summer 2016 Curriculum respository! [CODE @ TACC] (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/education/stem-programs/code-at-tacc) is a residential summer program for rising high school juniors and seniors hosted by the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin.

Our goal is to provide any student, regardless of experience, a rich STEM experience with a strong emphasis on electronics engineering and programming in a cloud driven world. TACC supports free and open source software. This curriculum is provided with MIT licensing. If you require support in implementing this curriculum or think that you would like to contribute, do not hesitate to contact us or send a pull request!

### Summer 2016

This year's curriculum features a robotics unit and wearables. Our primary development platform will be the Photon, created by [Particle.io](https://www.particle.io/). It is a WiFi development board with a [Web Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_integrated_development_environment), [Publish-Subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) events and variables, and [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook).

### This Curriculum

You may download this curriculum by clicking [this link](https://github.com/CODE-at-TACC/summer-2016/archive/master.zip). The documents in this repository are designed for those who are looking for a "textbook". Therefore, if you're a teacher and you need written activity plans and documentation, this is the place to look. If you're a student participant looking for video demonstrations, here's a link to a YouTube Channel. ** TODO: YouTube channel **

### Nuts and Bolts

Throughout this curriculum, you will see sections titled _Nuts and Bolts_. These sections provide a detailed explanation of the inner workings of whatever is being discussed in that section. You can read the summary if you are a student, or if you are a teacher who would like to be able to answer deeper questions, you can read the section.
