# Materials, Hardware, Supplies, etc.

### Computers and Software

CODE @ TACC materials are as platform independent as possible. We are using:

- Laptops with Windows
- WPA2 WiFi Router
- Unblocked connections to device.spark.io and device.particle.io, TCP port 5683

If you need to do any serious debugging of your Particle.io Photon, you will also need:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli/photon/)
- [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/)

### Project Hardware

We try to source our materials from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) and [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/). You may use the wishlists provided in each section for direct purchasing, or you may look at individual details if you want to pick and choose which components of each project you will implement.

- [Wearables Materials](./WEARABLES.md)

### Other Materials

Some activities will require other basic office supplies, like markers and butcher paper.
