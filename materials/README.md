# Materials, Hardware, Supplies, etc.

### Computers and Software

CODE @ TACC materials are as platform agnostic as possible. We are using:

- Laptops with Ubuntu Linux
- WPA2 WiFi
- Unblocked connections to device.spark.io and device.particle.io, TCP port 5683

Some parts of the curriculum will require the Particle Command Line Interface. This will require:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A good text editor. We recommend [GitHub's Atom](https://atom.io/)

If you need to do any serious debugging of your Particle.io Photon, you will also need:

- [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/)

### Project Hardware

We try to source our materials from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) and [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/). You may use the wishlists provided in each section for direct purchasing, or you may look at individual details if you want to pick and choose which components of each project you will implement. The entire curriculum is designed to be modular.

- [Wearables Materials](./WEARABLES.md)

### Other Materials

Some activities will require other basic office supplies, like markers and butcher paper.
