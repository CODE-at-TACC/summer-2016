# Robotics Materials

The CODE @ TACC curriculum doesn't use a pre-made kit for Robotics. None of the kits we found on the market provide Internet connectivity or cloud development. Therefore, we've chosen to select components and packages available at [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com) and [SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com) to construct our "kit".

You may use the following Wishlists to purchase everything at once for the robotics project, with the exception of Sunfounder Ultrasonic Rangefinders, mini breadboards and USB batteries. Those must be purchased from Amazon.com.
