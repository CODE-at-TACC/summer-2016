# Robotics Materials

The CODE @ TACC curriculum doesn't use a pre-made kit for Robotics. None of the kits we found on the market provide Internet connectivity or cloud development. Therefore, we've chosen to select components and packages available at [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com) and [SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com) to construct our "kit".

You may use the following Wishlists to purchase everything at once for the robotics project, with the exception of Sunfounder Ultrasonic Rangefinders. Those must be purchased from Amazon.com.

Here's a summary of the materials:

_**Robot logic, power and drive**_

|Item|Description|
|:----|:-----------|
|[SparkFun Photon Redboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13321)|Particle.io Photon in an Arduino form factor, to serve as an Internet enabled logic board for our robot. If you already have a Particle.io Photon, you may use a [Particle Shield Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2725) instead, but our 3D printing schematics will not be designed to fit this.|
|[PowerBoost 500 Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2078)| A power source in Arduino shield form for the robot|
|[LiPo Battery](https://www.adafruit.com/products/258)|These come in different sizes and polarities. If you wish to purchase a different battery, please make sure that it is a 3.7v LiPo chargeable battery with a compatible connector and polarity. A 1200mAh battery is the perfect size for our robot, but you could go larger if necessary.|
|[Continuous Rotation Servo](https://www.adafruit.com/products/154) x2|The motors for our wheels. We chose continuous rotation servos since they are geared and do not require separate hardware to drive the motor, such as an [H-Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge).
|[Servo Wheels](https://www.adafruit.com/products/167) x2|These attach nicely to the Continuous Rotation Servo|
|[Ball Caster](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1200)|Allows for free turning and support|

_**Sensors**_

|Item|Description|
|:----|:----------|
|[Micro Servo](https://www.adafruit.com/products/169)|Allows our "sensor mast" to turn|
|[Contact-less Infrared Temperature Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2023)|Allows the robot to "see" heat|
|[DH22 Temperature-Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/385)|Allows the robot to sense ambient temperature and humidity|
|[Hall Effect Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/158)|Allows the robot to sense the presence of a magnetic field|
|[Sunfounder Ultrasonic Sensor](http://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Ultrasonic-Distance-Mega2560-Duemilanove/dp/B00E0NXTJW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455919609&sr=8-1&keywords=ultrasonic+range+finder)|_This is the one item that has to come from Amazon.com_. Allows the robot to use sonar range finding. There are newer Ultrasonic Range Finders on both Adafruit and SparkFun that are automotive grade (for when your car is backing up) but they are more expensive
