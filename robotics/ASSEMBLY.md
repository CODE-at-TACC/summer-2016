# Assembling Your Robotics Kit

Some soldering may be required. Follow this instructional video to put together your robot and flash it with firmware.

### Nuts and Bolts

TL;DR - [How to solder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKbJxytERvg).

_*Soldering*_

It's not that bad, really. Here are some tips:

- Use a low wattage soldering iron.
- Make sure that you unplug the iron when it's not in use.
- Learn to clean and tin your tip. This maintains the heat conductivity of the tip.
- If you are soldering headers onto a board, you can use a breadboard or other components to actually hold everything in place, in the way that a jig holds.pieces of wood you are trying to join
- Practice.

_*Screws*_

Most components use the metric system for screws. In this case, many of the components use M4 screws - 4mm screws. Locking nuts help immensely to make sure the robot stays together.

_*Chassis Kits*_

There are many chassis kits out there, and there are even [aluminum chassis sytems](https://youtu.be/mxAWhiE75Og) that you can use to make just bout anything. You might ask, "why not just use Legos like you did last year?" In addition, to the core Mindstorms system requiring the use of non-open source software, we found the cost to be too high for a program focused more on the electrical engineering and programming aspects of this year's curriculum.

_*Firmware*_

In this introductory lesson, we are using pre-programmed firmware. This is so that the robot is definitely "doing something" when it is built. Later, we will go into programming the robot.
