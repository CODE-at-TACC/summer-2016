# FOOTBALL TIME!

### Introduction

Your class is going to divide into two teams and you're going to play football against each other. (American football. With the end zones, downs, line of scrimmage, etc.)

### Setting up Plays

Each team should plan [offensive and defensive plays](http://plugandplayfootball.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bigstock_Plan_of_a_football_game_14340857.jpg). Every robot on a team will have its own firmware, programmed so that each robot can fulfill its role within a play. An individual robot can have up to four exposed functions.

When play starts, everyone on both teams runs their team's selected play.

### Football Rules for People Who Don't Watch Football at All

In American Football, teams take turns being the offense or the defense. The offensive team's objective is to get the ball across the field to the end zone. The field is 100 yards long. The offense possesses the ball and has 4 chances or "downs" to move the ball forward at least 10 yards. If they do so, they return to "1st down." If they fail to do so after the 4th down, there is a turnover and the defense becomes the offense. A successful touchdown awards 6 points.

There are a lot of other rules that I will neglect to mention here, such as kickoffs, extra points, conversions, touchbacks, rules for passing, penalties, etc.

### Robot Football Rules

_*Robotic football rules are simplified*_

- There is no passing and ever play is a running play made by the Quarterback.
- There are no kicks of any type, with every new play after a touchdown starting at the 40 yard line.
- There is no extra point or two point conversion. A touchdown is 7 points.
- A down is considered when a robot on the opposing team touches the quarterback or the quarterback goes out of bounds.
- Every play is limited to 10 seconds.

_*Procedures of play*_

- The offense lines up their robots on the line of scrimmage first.
- The defensive team lines up their robots after the offense lines up their robots.
- The offense then gets to designate the Quarterback (which will carry the ball) after the defense has lined up.
- Both teams are allowed to huddle for 10 seconds.
- When the referee says "go," every team is allowed to execute their play.
- 10 seconds after the referee says "go", forward progress by the Quarterback immediately ends.

### Nuts and Bolts

TL;DR - Your students will find ways of subverting rules. [The history of football has a lot of subversion of rules](http://www.radiolab.org/story/who-are-we-carlisle-carlisle-carlisle/).

_*Exposed Functions and Plays*_

Particle.io is limited to four exposed functions. Typically, students will end up making their four functions "maneuvers", such as "left hook", "right hook", "straight", "run back and go up the side". This allows them to diversify the number of plays that a team can do based off of different positions performing combinations of these maneuvers. This also allows individual players to take options for option plays.

_*Troubleshooting*_

Football can be kind of rough on robots. They were never meant to be involved in contact sports. Rubber bands and twist ties can be used to secure loose wires. Instead of using an actual ball, you may wish to use a post-it note to represent a ball (and you can allow for fumbles!)
